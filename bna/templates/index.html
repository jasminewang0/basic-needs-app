    <h1>Wake County Basic Needs Resources</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This is the homepage of our application. We are trying to connect Wake County
      residents with basic needs resources from their location via public transportation.
      We have parsed the <a href="https://www.ncworks.gov/admin/gsipub/htmlarea/uploads/CRAG/Wake_County_(Raleigh_LO).pdf">
      Wake County Community Resource Guide</a>, loaded it into a database, and will show you how
      to get to certain resources through local public transportation with Google Maps.

      Choose a category from the dropdown above to get started!
